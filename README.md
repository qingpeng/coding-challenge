Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
===========================================================

I submitted two version, with different data structure and algorithms.

I started to work on  the faster version this afternoon and just got it finished on time.
So I couldn't have the opportunity to do the unit testing.

Now the faster version can process the 10000 line in about 5 seconds, much faster than the slower version (>20 seconds).
